## Notes
'welcom to port..'
i'm a web devloper
Brian keegan

organize skill, to importance

convince people, or show how it was challenging, and how it was cool
assume reader has no context of GA

talk about process of builing app

instead of screen shot, think about image to portray process, or way to
sell concept

give opinion on techs

q: I love your idea of using images to sell my process, but I've had a lot of trouble finding images, and the visual design aspect

You don't want people to think your only have 3 months of experience.
You want this to be a marriage from past and ga experience.

Get more into history with about me

context of portfolios
'i was hired to x for y'

Make sure key elements are sold, beyond About

unclear what the projects are.
sell them beyond the image

Imagine someone else is talking to you about your project.
Or someone who is super proud of you.
How was it awesome?

Object:  Client wanted this
Result: utilized.. etc

Use bootstrapf framework in order easy for client to update

Client Projects

Use Image from Sound Dictionary

const x = document.body.querySelectorAll('script')
x[x.length -1].nextSibling
x[x.length -1].nextElementSibling.style.display = "none"
